## Initial setup

```sh
git clone git@github.com:openformation/recruiting-challenge-frontend-engineer.git

cd recruiting-challenge-frontend-engineer

npm run install
```

## Configuration

In order to connect your frontend application with the respective backend, you have to copy the example `env` file and add the secrets you've received in your challenge description document.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Afterwards, you can start the application locally via `npm run dev`. When everything has been booted up correctly, you can reach the following services:

- UI: http://localhost:3000
- GraphQL API: http://localhost:3000/api/graphql
- UI Storybook: http://localhost:3001

## And now ...

Have fun!! ðŸŽ‰
